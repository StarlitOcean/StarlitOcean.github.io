    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
<p>Kaho Hayden, an ace trainer in Bea’s gym in Stow-on-Side decided to take on the Sinnoh championship. After training for an entire year in the desert of Route 111 in Hoenn her mother’s homeregion. She knew it wouldn’t be easy, since her own niece tried to take on the elite four and failed when she tried to defeat Cynthia.  However, with a deep prayer to Arceus she approached the last gym in her journey to Sinnoh and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>She entered. She noticed various people coming and going.  Some with wounded pokemon, probably defeated. Among them were a couple who were wearing VIP access passes.  Probably she knew the one of them from the tv; he was a tall, pale man with long, green hair and a woman with a slightly dark skin and light blue and long hair.  She recalled that the man was the Prince of Unova and the woman was his fiancée.</p>
<p>“Haha, they lost. Noobs !” giggled Kaho as she thought that. Eventually she bumped on someone. She looked up and noticed the owner of the gym. He was looking into his palm and just swallowed something, which was followed by water.</p>
<p>“Hey, you must be Volkner !” she said charmed. The tall, dirty blond man gave her a side-glance and then turned to face her.</p>
<p>“A man just can’t take his depression pills in peace in here, can he ?” he said annoyed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’m just overjoyed to see you. You’re a legend.” Said Kaho. “By the way, this is quite a beautiful city you live in.” she gave him her most charming grin.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear so.  The surroundings were made by Arceus, I just added the technology and the Architects added the houses.” He gave her a weak smile.</p>
<p>“Pity that a hunk like him suffers from depression.” Thought Kaho, but then she recalled the time in the desert in Hoenn, route 111.  She nearly drove crazy herself, if it wasn’t for her pokemon.  Especially that fuzzy angel, her Furret. She had her Furret since she was 11. His name was Archer. Back to the fact that she liked Volkner, she always liked men older than her.  Back when had travelled to Alola with her sister, she liked that policeman with the endless Alolan Meowths.  She always had a thing for Silver Foxes.  The guy was a friend of Kabu’s, she had a crush over Kabu, but not as much as the thing she had for Drayden from Unova, who his wife nearly kicked her out of the gym, because Kaho thought she was just a  random person and told her, that she liked him. If Kaho had to think through her life…she’d have a lot of things to regret, but decided not to think about it.  Her sister on the other hand…a big softie, hit on Falkner and nearly had her precious curls pulled off by Jinea.  Falkner’s wife.</p>
<p>“HEY !” Volkner told her, making her return to reality.</p>
<p>“Oh hey !” Kaho jolted as she was staring out of the window to the beautiful city below.</p>
<p>“You must be here for something.  Well, why don’t you tell me your dream ?” asked Volkner.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you my dream’s process.” Smirked Kaho, knowing that such men get impressed by acts like hers.  “I spent an entire year in the desert in Hoenn in route 111.  My only companion were my pokemon and currently I am known as the Wild Flower of Stow-On-Side. You must be wondering why.  I’ll tell you why.  Because I was an ace trainer in Bea’s gym.” She paused and looked deep into his eyes. “I also got all the badges to get to meet you for this job meeting, but I won’t say no to a battle.” Said Kaho rubbing her chin.</p>
<p>Volkner rubbed his own chin and furrowed his eyebrows. Kaho started sounding interesting and she loved getting all his attention, despite not being exactly a silver fox.</p>
<p>“You might be hired…after you show me what you got in a battle.” Said Volkner with a smirk. The two of them left and went ahead to battle.</p>
<p>Kaho won.  It was a Pyrrhic victory though, since her two first pokemon were defeated.</p>
<p>“Oh boy !  Are you a tough customer or what ?” she said with a smirk and put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>Volkner smirked on his own. “You’ve got no idea who you’re messing with.  I like your spirit though.  Hired !” said Volkner and they approached one another to clap one another’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Do I get to keep being an Ace Trainer ?” she asked as he walked ahead. He turned around.</p>
<p>“Of course.” He said and turned back to keep walking. Kaho was beyond happy and started walking around with her Lucario and her Furret.</p>
    
    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
    
<p>Kaho was once again a powerhouse.  This time in Volkner’s gym.  She was proud of herself. She was at the moment toying with her ultraball.  She was thankful at the moment though to both Arceus and Volkner for letting her keep her current pokemon lineup, just like how Bea had done.</p>
<p>“If only I had a meowth with an Amulet Coin that knows Pay Day every time I was fighting a gym challenger that loses to me !” said Kaho proudly. Just then though Volkner was passing by.</p>
<p>He was holding a water bottle and more depression pills than usual.</p>
<p>“Hey ! Is everything ok ?” asked Kaho worried.</p>
<p>“No.” the voice barely made it out of his body. Kaho could feel the fingers of his voice and conscience pointing at her.</p>
<p>“Um…may I ask why ?” asked Kaho feeling so bad with herself already.</p>
<p>“You are the problem.  You break everyone wings, bring them down and stomp them like a freaking Tsareena. Why do you fight like that ? This isn’t win or die, you know.” Said Volkner and let a tsk escape his throat. Kaho lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Sorry.  I just like fighting…a lot? Sorry for getting defensive. I know there’s no excuse.” Said Kaho feeling horrible with herself.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.  Next time keep a challenger for me.” Said Volkner with a weak smile.</p>
<p>“Alright.  I shall head to my office. Good thing we are still overflowing with people. I got to see Falkner’s wife; Jinea.  I heard she was born and raised on Sinnoh.” Said Kaho.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s a great person.  She plans on defeating Cynthia.  About time.” Said Volkner with a weak smile. He resumed.  “Did you get to see anyone else ?” he said.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” Kaho pondered. “Nelly Thalia Kassiani, the wife of my celebrity crush, Drayden.  She’s so pretty ! And this one Catalina Sana, but I don’t understand what she was doing here.  I mean…I know she’s the wife of Brawly, but she was here but not looking for the badge ? The heck ?” wondered Kaho.</p>
<p>“Oh ! Brawly is an old friend and his wife is a friend too.  So, they probably wanted sea directions.” Chuckled Volkner eventually. “You won’t believe but the wife of N from Unova along with N also came here.  The day you firstly came.” Volkner nodded with a faint smirk.</p>
<p>“I think I saw the two of them.” Nodded Kaho. </p>
<p>Just then entered Steven Stone, Abigail Nightingale, the celebrated grass-type champion. Not everyone dares to take on the Elite Four of Hoenn with just grass types.  They of course weren’t pure grass, except for her Tsareena, but still, it was an interesting battle…or so Kaho recalls.</p>
<p>“Welcome. How’s it going, Steve ?” asked Volkner with a smirk. Kaho couldn’t help but admire his style.</p>
<p>“All good as usual.” He said with a much more apparent smirk.  Steven Stone wasn’t affected by depression and it was obvious.</p>
<p>Kaho put her hand behind Volkner and whispered in his ear to go fight on her behalf to feel the fire of battle.  He nodded.</p>
<p>“So ! Who’s up for a good, ol’ battle ?” said Volkner cheerfully.  He could feel the spirit between rivals already rising the adrenaline in the area.</p>
<p>“Double battle, Volkner.  My wife wants to try her team against you.  I believe we will win.” Steven, removed his aviators and gave both Volkner and Kaho a glare, however, a charming glare.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well.  I’m gonna give it my all.  I won’t go easy on a couple of champions no matter what.” Said Kaho and cracked her knuckles.</p>
<p>“You don’t impress me either.” Said Abigail narrowing her eyes to scare Kaho as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p>
<p>The battle soon started.  Volkner got out his Jolteon.  Kaho got her Tyranitar. Steven got his Shiny Mega Metagross and Kaho couldn’t help, but roll her eyes at the show-off as his wife admired him. Abigail (his wife), got out her Tsareena.</p>
<p>It was a real massacre for both sides.</p>
<p>Metagross went down by Jolteon and Tyranitar went down by Tsareena. Therefore Kaho got her Lucario, which can somehow take some grass damage due to being half-steel typing. Steven got his Carbink out of spite, being angry beyond measure since his beloved Metagross had been defeated.</p>
<p>“This one will be tough.” Thought Kaho and attacked with a Blaze Kick against Tsareena, making her faint.</p>
<p>Volkner decided to say to his Jolteon to attack with pin missiles and soon Steven’s Carbink fainted.</p>
<p>Kaho was left with 2 pokemon, Steven with 1 and Abigail with 2. Volkner seemed to be the calmer of all since he had no fainted pokemon. It was the third round and Steven got out his Claydol, which with an extrasensory attack knocked out Kaho’s Lucario. Kaho grit her teeth and got out her Bastiodon, who she had trained all so well in all her time in Sinnoh. Bastiodon was bulky and that’s something that Kaho loved about him.  She was calling him Heavy-Duty. He attacked with an Ice beam and since Steven’s pokemon lost, the foe duo lost. Volkner was proud of his partner, Kaho. Since he managed to defeat a champion. Not like he hadn’t done that with N, but it felt even better today, maybe because he felt particularly down in the dumps today.</p>
<p>With that Steven and Abigail left with a warm goodbye as Volkner and Kaho left for their homes to rest.</p>
    
    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
    
<p>It was yet another sunny day of early September.  People were still sunbathing in the beach, a place that Kaho was avoiding and waiting right outside the Sunyshore gym for Volkner to arrive and open it, something that happened soon.  However, challengers weren’t arriving that early. So Volkner and Kaho took their sweet time in their offices. Just then Volkner opened his laptop and noticed a strange e-mail.</p>
<p>“Just what is Freezington ? And Galarian Zapdos ? What does that have to do with Sunyshore ? With the gym ? With me ? With you ?” asked Volkner exasperated.</p>
<p>“Um…there’s something I haven’t told you…my father’s from Galar…Stow-on-Side.” Smirked Kaho.  Volkner took on a strict expression.</p>
<p>“Kaho…this isn’t from your father.” Said Volkner deep in thought.</p>
<p>“True.” She agreed pondering who sent them the e-mail about Freezington.</p>
<p>As a good 5 uneventful minutes passed, Volkner finally spoke up. “This is very curious.  I say we follow it.” He said and scratched his chin in thought.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright.  Let’s go.” Said Kaho and sighed. “Please let me make my luggage first.” She said feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>With that Volkner and Kaho headed to their homes to make their luggage and meet again in the local airport.</p>
<p>That happened and they met at the airport.  Kaho was ready and so was Volkner, they soon embarked and they flew, over various regions, at some point, Volkner pointed Unova at her, but he noticed that maybe Kaho had her head turned towards the window but she was asleep, so he took off his navy blue jacket and covered her as he also decided to sleep and he assumed a sleeping position.</p>
<p>~x~</p>
<p>Soon the airplane landed on Wyndon and they disembarked and then they took the train to Freezington.  It took some time but it finally arrived at their destination. However, nothing was there. No one at all.</p>
<p>“So now what ?” asked Kaho.  She was wearing a heavy parka in lilac color.</p>
<p>Volkner got his smartphone out and searched “Galarian Zapdos.” He found nothing, but he got an e-mail since he had his data turned on.</p>
<p>“If you want to find the Galarian Zapdos, be as fast as lightning and go to the Wild Area before Motostoke, at the place where they call MeetUp-Spot.” Read the e-mail.</p>
<p>“Does it say where is it from ?” asked Kaho freezing.</p>
<p>“No, the IP address is hidden.” Replied Volkner, scratching his chin in thought.</p>
<p>“Well, off we are.” Said Kaho and went back to the Freezington Train Station.</p>
<p>With that that they went to the Wild Area before Motostoke and stopped at the MeetUp-Spot.</p>
<p>There waited a pokemon that looked much like a combination of an ostrich and Zapdos.</p>
<p>“Wow, what a peculiar pokemon !” said Kaho in awe.</p>
<p>“Kind of reminds me of a Zapdos.” Said Volkner and got out an ultra ball. However, the wild, legendary pokemon started running away.</p>
<p>“I go this way, you go that way.” Said Volkner with a serious face running towards it.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Kaho and went around one of the lakes.</p>
<p>After a lot of chasing they trapped it and Volkner caught it in a quick ball.</p>
<p>“Damn !” thought Kaho impressed.</p>
<p>Volkner’s usual gloomy expression was replaced by a beautiful, pearly grin.</p>
<p>“Heh, that’s something.” He said to Kaho and patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>“So, now what ?” Kaho asked Volkner with curiosity.</p>
<p>“I say we take a break and enjoy our time here.  I have to come to Galar in a long time.” Smirked Volkner looking once at Kaho and once at the quick ball in which was the Galarian Zapdos.</p>
<p>From now on they’d be on vacation.</p>
    
    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
    
<p>They spent the first day with the Galarian Zapdos in the pokeball in Motostoke.  It was thankfully a sunny day and Volkner in his room was looking outside at the early sunrise while Kaho from her room was sleeping seeing dreams.</p>
<p>“Arceus, the sun looks so wonderful.” Said Volkner looking at the sun rising. After the sun rose. He went outside of his room knocking on Kaho’s.</p>
<p>Kaho, sleepy as she was rose from her bed and opened the door.</p>
<p>“Kaho.” Said Volkner with a smirk until he noticed her braid. “Don’t tell me you sleep with that braid ?” asked Volkner shocked.</p>
<p>“Well, I make it once per week…if that soothes your mind.” She yawned and sat at the edge of her bed. Volkner looked at her fine silhouette that was finely shaped by her summer pair of pyjama top and bottom. He swallowed hard at the look of her fine figure.</p>
<p>“What time is it Volkner ?” yawned Kaho sleepily.</p>
<p>“6 o clock. Welcome to the early-wakers club.” He kidded her.</p>
<p>“Aww !” Kaho fell back down on her single bed.</p>
<p>“Don’t get lazy now. The sun is great this time of the day.” He said.  Kaho opened her brown eyes and looked out of her window.  She was a lazy girl, she liked sports though, she had to admit that, so she wasn’t 100% lazy more like 51%. She could easily wear herself out during sports and yet be lazy in all other things. She eventually woke up and crossed her arms on her chest.</p>
<p>“Alright, now we are seeing the sun.  Now what ?” asked Kaho.</p>
<p>“Be bright, be cheery.  It’s sunrise during summer.” Said Volkner happily.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright.  I just need some coffee in my system.” Yawned Kaho slightly. She kinda knew he was crazy about electricity and sun.  He reminded her of Wattson, but more handsome and intelligent. After rubbing her eyes, she admired him as he headed to the phone to ask the room service for a couple of coffees.  Filter coffees, one with sugar and cream and one with just a spoonful.</p>
<p>“He’s handsome and caring !” thought Kaho and looked at him being hyperactive. “Gosh, he’s adorable.” She blushed.  Volkner was all the adorableness in one place. Kaho blushed even more.  Her face was much like a cherry. Soon Volkner stood before her with crossed arms and she paled before the time she’d like to.</p>
<p>“Um, yes ?” the fear she felt from him standing before her woke her up even more than coffee ever did in her entire life.</p>
<p>“Just wondering…do you really drink your coffee with cream and sugar ? Or was I mistaken ? Sorry…sun is making me run in turbo.” Chuckled Volkner as he scratched the back of his head in awkwardness.</p>
<p>“No, you were right.” Kaho giggled herself.</p>
<p>Soon the room service brought the couple cups of coffee, which were drunk in minutes.  After that Kaho suggested that they train in the Wild Area before Motostoke till the shops open.</p>
<p>After training they headed to Budew Drop Hotel and paid and then moved on to Hammerlocke on foot while training.  They were also chatting.</p>
<p>“That was exciting.” Said Kaho to Volkner, who seemed excited.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I heard Hulbury is interesting.” Said Kaho as she was trying to break the ice.</p>
<p>“Really ? Then let’s go there then.” Said Volkner cheerfully.</p>
<p>“Yep, it’s sunny, has a lighthouse.  It will remind you of Sunyshore.” Said Kaho as she was trying to charm her crush.</p>
<p>“Hmm, interesting.” Said Volkner looking at Kaho the whole time.  He couldn’t take his eyes off him.  Little did Kaho know, Volkner liked her back.  They really needed to break the ice.  It was all due to the small, yet still existing, age gap.</p>
<p>Eventually night sunset was upon them.</p>
<p>“Only a kilometer away till Hammerlocke.” Said Kaho.  She was endurable.</p>
<p>“I…I don’t think I can make it.” Said Volkner panting. “I have to walk this much in a very long while.” He kept on breathing heavily.</p>
<p>“Want to camp out here ? I have some ingredients for curry.” Said Kaho cheerfully  sitting close to him.</p>
<p>“Sure, if you have any good recipes.” Smiled Volkner, who now was looking at her lips as they were moving.  However, he wasn’t paying at attention.</p>
<p>“I will have the first one.” Said Volkner with an infatuated grin.  He was blushing by the fire before him.</p>
<p>“Gigantamax curry ? Oh man, you’re gonna be bloated.” Said Kaho with a  friendly,  yet amused giggle. “Don’t you worry I love it too.”</p>
<p>Kaho made the curry.  They soon started eating and Volkner couldn’t help but praise her cooking.  It was tasty, but he couldn’t eat it all.</p>
<p>“I will save some for tomorrow.” Said Kaho sweetly and tidied up as Volkner was looking up at the starry sky and the crescent moon.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m off to sleep.” She said yawning.</p>
<p>“Good night.” Said Volkner with a weak smile as he was taking his nightly depression pills.</p>
<p>Kaho was waiting for a “Sweet Dreams.”  That she never got.  She sulked and went in the tent. Volkner felt her frustration, but he didn’t know why.  However, he slept outside sulking himself.  Thinking of how to make it up to Kaho. He eventually slept.</p>

    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
    
<p>The next morning shone upon the Wild Area close to Hammerlocke. Volkner was still asleep as Kaho woke up with a headache.</p>
<p>“That was a heavy sleep.” She grimaced due to the pain. She looked around and noticed Volkner sleeping on the ground. Her lips curled into a weak smile. She thought of how necessary he had become to her and how peacefully he was sleeping.</p>
<p>“Oh Arceus, he’s adorable.” Said Kaho and sat next to him.</p>
<p>However, Volkner felt the heat of her body.  Extra heat made him sweat. He woke up and noticed her having breakfast right by his side. He yawned.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Kaho.  You are early today.” He said as he was happy to see her.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed. Would you like a spare sandwich ? I have one with avocado and chili flakes.  Great for keeping shape.” She said with a smile, then she took a bite of her sandwich.</p>
<p>“I’m sure.  I’d like to try something like that.” Said Volkner and goggled his eyes open to see Kaho’s body being so close to his, but she soon left to go inside the tent and get the sandwich.</p>
<p>“Just as I was waking up.” He thought feeling bummed out.</p>
<p>“Here it is.” Said Kaho re-exiting the tent.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Replied Volkner. Kaho was awaiting something more than just a mere thank you.</p>
<p>“I’m never gonna charm him, am I ?” she thought, but kept a smile on her features.</p>
<p>They had breakfast for a bit longer and eventually packed their things and headed to Hammerlocke. There Volkner and Kaho noticed the beautiful city.</p>
<p>“I prefer Motostoke.  It’s more practical.” Said Volkner critically.</p>
<p>“I have to say that I prefer Motostoke, only because my father is a friend of Kabu. But as a sucker of architecture, I have to admit that I prefer this city.” Said Kaho with embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Being honest is a virtue, Kaho.  Don’t feel bad.” Said Volkner with a smirk. Kaho blushed.</p>
<p>“So, as a native Galarian, I have to say that the Battle Cafes of Galar are great.  I’ve been to Motostoke’s Battle Café, but never to Hammerlocke’s.  I heard they offer different teas here.  So what would you say if we were to have a tea here ?” asked Kaho cutely.</p>
<p>“Sure, but I’ll have a coffee.” Said Volkner feeling good with Kaho by his side.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll have a coffee too.” She giggled.</p>
<p>Soon the two of them were in a Battle Café.  There was view no view to the impressive stadium, but there was side view to the gate, which was spectacular. However, only Volkner was gazing at absent-minded. Kaho was staring at the café’s counter.  Soon the waiter arrived with a filter coffee and a some water, so that Volkner would get his depression medicines. Kaho’s concentration was broken and looked back at Volkner taking his pills.</p>
<p>“All good ?” asked Kaho concerned.</p>
<p>“Yeah.  I’m just…feeling down in the dumps a lot lately despite our vacation.” Sighed Volkner.</p>
<p>“Same.” Replied Kaho and sighed.</p>
<p>“Why ?” asked Volkner curiously.</p>
<p>“I love someone, who doesn’t.” she replied.</p>
<p>“Oh damn, that sucks.” He sulked even more.</p>
<p>“What about you ?” asked Kaho in return.</p>
<p>“Same here.” He sighed loudly.</p>
<p>“My mother was always telling me this;…” started Kaho saying an advice her mother was telling her, hoping that Volkner would get to see her as a possible girlfriend. “…There are plenty more fish in the sea. Do I know who the woman you liked is ? I’ll tell you who I liked in return.” Suggested Kaho with a sad smile.  She was feeling as horrible as it gets. Little did she know soon enough she’d be the happiest in the whole Hammerlocke.</p>
<p>“It’s you, Kaho.  Why look for other fish, when I have you ?  You are funny, witty, beautiful…a dream to any man.” Volkner pinched the bridge of his nose as he based his elbow on the yellow table.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy ?!” said Kaho in a high-pitched voice.  She was so happy.  However, Volkner thought she was upset.</p>
<p>“Please don’t be mad.” He replied with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I’m not mad, I’m happy.” She explained.  Volkner looked up at her in curiosity. “I’m happy.  I’m beyond happy.  I love you too, Volkner.” Said Kaho crying in her palms out of joy.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying then ?” asked Volkner confused.</p>
<p>“I’m overjoyed !  Baby, I love you.” Said Kaho and bent over the table to kiss him on the lips.</p>
<p>“So…we are official now ?” he asked not sure how long this would last.</p>
<p>“According to me yes…you ?” asked Kaho.</p>
<p>“You betcha, baby.” Replied Volkner.  He paid the bill of their hot beverages, left a tip to celebrate (he said the man behind the counter that’s for him to drink a beer.) and walked out of the Battle Café.   Holding Kaho’s hand.</p>
<p>“Baby.” He told her.</p>
<p>“I love you.” Said Kaho sweetly. They kissed passionately.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll take you anywhere you want.  Any ideas ?” asked Volkner cheerfully.</p>
<p>“I know a good place.  Hulbury.” Replied Kaho with a huge grin on her features. “Sunny, by the beach, good, ol’ Hulbury.” Said Kaho and caressed Volkner’s face with the side of her palm. “I think you took too many depression pills and you now got overjoyed.” Kidded Kaho.</p>
<p>“I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that, depression is no kidding matter. I’m just happy to be together with the woman I love. “ he said with a tired expression.</p>
<p>With that they were off to Hulbury.</p>

    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
    
<p>The road to Hulbury was short and pleasant.  They finally had one another and that’s what mattered. Finally they were in Hulbury; it was sunny and breezy, rustling Volkner’s hair back, who was impressed by the town before him. In the motionless sea the sun was being reflected since it was noon and the high lighthouse was standing in the edge of the town.</p>
<p>“Wanna see the lighthouse ?” asked Kaho.</p>
<p>“You know me so well. Let’s go see it already.” Grinned Volkner.</p>
<p>With that they went ahead and walked into Hulbury.  The lively market piqued their interest since Kaho was looking for some TRs and TMs.</p>
<p>“Can we visit the market next ?” asked Kaho almost begging.  She was in cute mode.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Said Volkner with a smile. He felt so good today. Soon they reached the lighthouse and noticed some statues.</p>
<p>“This entire town is photo-worthy.” Smirked Kaho.</p>
<p>“Indeed, but I don’t have such a hobby.” Chuckled Volkner and noticed Kaho sitting on the bench as he walked further on the pier and saw the marina where all the yachts were parked.</p>
<p>“Feel the fresh oxygen the sea gives.” Said Volkner breathing in some air.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it feels good. What a beautiful, sunny day !” said Kaho and got out her Furret to keep her company as Volkner got out his Raichu. Kaho approached Volkner with a soft and pleasant smile.</p>
<p>“It’s almost as good as Sunyshore.” She said in a whisper.</p>
<p>“Nah, I doubt it.  Sunyshore is better. Everything is automatic there.” Said Volkner proudly.</p>
<p>“I just missed walking is all.  I’m more of an old-fashioned person.” She said.  Volkner looked at her surprised.</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t get offended.  I love you a lot, doesn’t mean I’m don’t like using my two own legs.  By the way, we should go roller skating one day.  I watch the sport on TV and it seems a lot of fun.” Said Kaho to Volkner.</p>
<p>“There’s a roller disco in Sunyshore.  It has good music too.  You’re gonna love it.” Said Volkner and tipped Kaho’s chin upwards so that she’d look straight into his irresistible, sapphire blue eyes. They locked lips for an uneventful minute.</p>
<p>“You, sweet genius of my heart.” Said Kaho falling in his arms.</p>
<p>“You wild girl of mine.” Said Volkner as he was holding her.</p>
<p>“You know.  I plan on taking you to my hometown.  My title there was; Wild Flower of Stow-on-Side.” She purred proudly.</p>
<p>“I believe that.” He said. With that hand in hand they walked to the market where both Volkner and Kaho bought several stuff for their pokemon and then decided to dine in a local restaurant. Later they’d head to their Hulbury b&amp;b.</p>
<p>“Lovely restaurant, Volkner.  I dig the nautical theme.” She said in a flirtatious manner towards her boyfriend.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t resist either.” Volkner said having a bite off his salad. There was no wine for ether of them, it was obvious why Volkner had none, but Kaho just hated alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>“So, what’s our next stop, ms.Tour Guide ?” said Volkner in a flirtatious manner looking deep into her beautiful light brown, almost honey brown eyes.</p>
<p>“I say we visit Stow-on-Side with a flying taxi. Next we go to Wyndon to take the plane and next we are off.  Wyndon is a large city.  You will love the sightseeing bus there.  There are a lot of nice things to see over there.  There are a few other towns but there’s not much to see there.” Said Kaho sweetly.</p>
<p>“I believe you then.” He said with a smile.</p>
<p>Then after dining, they headed back to the pier and they gazed off at the setting sun hand in hand.</p>
<p>“I love you, Volkner.” Said Kaho in a whisper.</p>
<p>“I love you, Kaho.” Volkner reciprocated the emotion with a purr of his own.</p>
<p>Later they headed to the b&amp;b to sleep and tomorrow head to Kaho’s hometown. </p>

    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
    
<p>The next day after waking up from a sweet and restful sleep, Kaho and Volkner headed off towards Stow-on-Side. Not like there was a lot to see there, but Volkner would get to meet Bea, the patient boss of Kaho.  Bea and Kaho were friends and still keeping in touch through the Rotom Phone.</p>
<p>“I’m very excited to see your former boss.” Said Volkner with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, she’s an excellent person.” Said Kaho to Vollkner joyfully and they kept going.</p>
<p>Eventually they reached Stow-on-Side, however the sun was intensely hot since it was summer and they were in the middle of the desert.</p>
<p>“Dear Arceus, that’s nothing like Sinnoh.  How can people live here ?” said Volkner.</p>
<p>“I still wonder why you wear your jacket. It’s summer, just as you said.” Replied Kaho slightly angry as she wanted to show him around.</p>
<p>“It’s a fashion statement piece. There’s no place that hot in the entire Sinnoh.” Complained Volkner.  Memories of the desert in route 111 flooded Kaho’s mind.</p>
<p>“It’s ok, Volkner.  The gym is air-conditioned.” She smiled and they headed towards Bea’s gym.</p>
<p>After some stairs they were there.  This gym was of normal size, much like the one in Hulbury. The ones in Motostoke and Hammerlocke were huge.  Volkner made a mental note on that.</p>
<p>“Isn’t there a normal gym in Galar ?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s Spikemuth, but…yeah. I don’t really go there.  Shady people.” Said Kaho grimacing in displeasure. “It’s more like a music stage anyways.” She explained.</p>
<p>“You Galarians are strange.” Said Volkner with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me.  I’m half Galarian/half Hoennian.” Said Kaho with a cute smile. Volkner stopped walking and gave a soft and tender kiss on Kaho’s lips.</p>
<p>“C’mon let’s go. I’m burning.” He complained one last time and soon they were on the threshold of the stadium.</p>
<p>Bea was just arriving with a challenger.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you…you’re not late.  I’m just opening for the day.” Explained Bea to the person behind her. She stopped for a bit to look at Kaho.</p>
<p>“If it’s not the Wild Flower of Stow-on-Side. Welcome, would you like to get back in track…or did you and that guy came here as viewers ?” said Bea happily with a grin.</p>
<p>“Hey Bea, great to see you again. Yeah, he will be a viewer.  I will show him all I had back then.  I even brought my team.” Said Kaho proudly and got out her Tyranitar.</p>
<p>“You will never change pokemon no matter what, will ya ?” said Bea shaking her head.</p>
<p>“You know Bea.  If I was to abandon the pokemon I grew up with and switch teams every time I get to work in different gyms.  Now I’d end up end due to my immense sorrow. My pokemon are precious to me.  I’m never gonna change them.”</p>
<p>“Yep, she does the same to my own gym.” Chuckled Volkner from the back. Bea giggled.</p>
<p>“So, what’s your line-up now ?” asked Bea curiously.</p>
<p>“I’m allowed 2 pokemon. So I have 2 of mine. Heliolisk and Furret. However, they are really badass.” Said Kaho with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Awesome.  Be my ace trainer for a bit, like in the past and fight this boy. I will be watching.  If you manage, I will fight him off at the stadium.  Best of success.” Said Bea.</p>
<p>Kaho got her old place and waited for the boy to approach her and he did.  She fought him off and he lost, leaving crying complaining that now he wanted sweets.</p>
<p>“Great as always, Wild Flower.  I didn’t expect you to win with a Heliolisk, but you managed well.” Bea praised Kaho, who offered her hand for a high five.</p>
<p>They stayed there a bit longer and talked as well as snacked. Then they left and Kaho showed Volkner the small market before them and that she once purchased an item there named beast ball.  She showed it to Volkner, but he also had no idea what it was.  However, it was fancy-looking.</p>
<p>After the market they headed to Kaho’s parents’ home.</p>
<p>Her father opened the door. He rose an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Kaho…who’s he ?” asked her father.</p>
<p>“Volkner, the pokemon leader from Sunyshore Gym in Sinnoh.” He said with one of his sunny grins.  They were rare but precious.</p>
<p>Kaho’s father smiled and accepted them inside.  Soon her mother arrived and they all talked about all sort of things but mostly about their relationship. They may had some years difference, but they ended up approving. Kaho and Volkner ended up sleeping there for the night and tomorrow as Kaho explained to her father, she and her boyfriend would head to Wyndon, where they’d eventually take the airplane and head back to Sinnoh and eventually Sunyshore city.</p>
    
    <li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
    
<p>Volkner and Kaho were walking towards Wyndon like these young kids that want to be pokemon trainers.  However, they had to stop at some point since they had ended up dangerously close to Glimwood Tangle.</p>
<p>“Um.  We should probably get a Flying Taxi.  We got disoriented.” Said Kaho worried. With that, she used her rotom phone and sent a message of her location to the closest Flying Taxi and it took them to Wyndon.</p>
<p>“Wow ! This place is huge !” said Volkner seeing the Rose Tower.</p>
<p>“Of course it is.  It belongs to Chairman Rose…he pretty much controls everything…I think so.” Said Kaho with a shrug and a sweet smile to show her innocence.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I wish I had a camera to take pictures.” Murmured Volkner looking downcast.</p>
<p>“Did you take your pills today ?” asked Kaho worried, really close to him staring deep into his sapphire blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Of course.” He replied with a smile.  He loved it when Kaho cared for him. They exchanged a deep, wet kiss.</p>
<p>After that, they started once again to walk towards the airport.</p>
<p>~x~</p>
<p>Back at Sinnoh. They took the train and ended up at Sunyshore. However, this time it was Kaho, who felt depressed.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong Kaho ?” asked Volkner sweetly, hugging her from behind.</p>
<p>“I wish we had more time to go around places.” She sighed.  She was the one feeling depressed now.</p>
<p>“Come on baby.  It was fun.” Volkner said and continued. “What would make you happy right now ?” asked Volkner in an unusually cheerful mood.</p>
<p>“Nothing.”  Kaho sighed again.</p>
<p>“C’mon let’s get married today.” Volkner nodded.</p>
<p>“Wait…you…for real ? You mean that ?” asked Kaho being shocked.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Replied Volkner with a nod.</p>
<p>“I…” Kaho was astonished.</p>
<p>“I liked you ever since you came here.  So why not marry you now this is as a good moment as any.” Volkner replied and showed her a ring. However, he didn’t do the kneeling thing.</p>
<p>“Damn ! I do ! I do !” shouted Kaho joyfully. She was about to cry. “You idiot, why didn’t you say anything ?  I liked you since I saw you too.” Said Kaho and hugged him crying on his shoulder.</p>
<p>With that Kaho and Volkner went ahead and got wed at Hearthome city. They sealed their union of hearts with a deep kiss, despite Kaho and Volkner being wed in their usual clothes.</p>
